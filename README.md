# Network A: Linking the road network and land use data
This notebook constructs and integrates an OpenStreetMap-based road network with land use data to explore how different land use patterns interact with transport infrastructure. It demonstrates spatial linking between network topology and land use categories to support accessibility and urban structure analysis.
